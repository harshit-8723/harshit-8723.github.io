So… it’s been a while, hasn’t it? Yeah, I’ve been away for a bit. I’ve grown a lot since then, and now I’m in my second year. My PESE (Practical for Employability Skill Assessment) faculty has asked us to start keeping a journal of the lectures again. Yes, just like we did in the second semester.

In our first class, Aditi Ma’am gave a general introduction about the subject and how we would proceed with it. Ma’am shared some very insightful things about life.

After that, Ma’am shared valuable insights from her own life, which helped me gain a larger perspective on life and what it’s like as a person grows. It was then time for the students to give their introductions, but before that, some students started asking Ma’am questions—just so the time would pass and they wouldn’t have to introduce themselves. Ma’am, without falling for their trick, started the self-introduction process herself.

Well, that all happened, and as the class was about to end, Ma’am handed us some homework...  
The homework for today was: updating our LinkedIn profiles, making an e-Portfolio, and creating a self-introductory video. She also gave some students the task of conducting an activity in the next class.

It was really fun attending the class and gaining some valuable knowledge.
