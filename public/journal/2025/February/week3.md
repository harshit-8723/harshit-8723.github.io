Today In our class we had discussion to the Personal Profiling Sheet Questions that were not done yet.  This give me a broader knowledge how to answer such types of questions when they are asked in general .

After that we had our first activity of our PESE class .

Ma'am also gave showed the way to give presentation professionally so that in the next Presentation class we would mentally prepared how we have to present.

The Activity was of "Drawing the diagram by just giving some instructions to the other team member but not telling the whole"

Which was really fun to see students giving their all to get to the answer.

Home Work  of Today's class : complete Personal Profiling Sheet  and completing of our PPT for next class.
