I was just on time to the class , as coming through public vehicle I was just about to be late.

Class was started and now It was to be decided which group is going to speak, in what order we should call the group ? 

Ma'am decided to go through the way of chits to decide randomly the order of group . And surprisingly our Group was the  first to present . Me and my teammates  were little bit nervous but as we go through the process we all were feeling little bit confident , there were some of my team mates who are going to speak for the first time and  that a achievement for them. Our topic for the presentation was " AI Delma : Challenges and Path forward ". We delivered our best and at the last ma'am gave us suggestions on what was good and what could be improved. 

It was really informative and knowledgeable to see other students presentation. 

Well over all I liked this because this presentation activity helped to know the correct way to deliver professional  presentations and what to improve on (given suggestions by Ma'am).
