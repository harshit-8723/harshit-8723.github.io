Today, we appeared for our PESE examination. The questions provided by ma'am were based on the profiling sheet that had been shared with us beforehand. We were allotted approximately 20 minutes to complete the written portion of the exam. Following that, a viva session was conducted, during which we were asked questions related to our responses and overall understanding. The exam process was smooth and helped reinforce the topics we had covered earlier.
