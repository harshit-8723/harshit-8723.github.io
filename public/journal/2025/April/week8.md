Learning LSRW Techniques and Vocabulary Building

Today in class, we learned about the LSRW technique in English, which stands for Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Ma'am explained how all four skills are important to improve our overall communication in English. She also shared a useful tip for building vocabulary—by learning 5 new words every day throughout the week and using Sundays for revision.

Ma'am also taught us how to create good content using WH questions like who, what, when, where, why, and how. This helps in making our writing and speaking more detailed and meaningful. We also learned about Ethos, Pathos, and Logos, which are techniques used to make our communication more effective. Ethos is about building trust, Pathos is about connecting with emotions, and Logos is about using logic and facts.

Overall, it was an informative session and I got to know some new ways to improve my English skills.

And ma'am gave us the home work to use these technique to write speech on any to pic of our choice.
